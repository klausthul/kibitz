Status & Goals
======

This software works great on Mac OS X 10.10+ and connects to the FICS chess server and compatible clones. Some features are missing and help is needed on this project.

The main project goal is to release a production-capable native Mac FICS chess client. The code will be reusable and support iOS/TV targets as well.
