Status & Goals
======

This software works great on Mac OS X Carbon and against older FICS chess servers. The code is now being actively updated to work with current FICS servers and OS X Cocoa.

The main project goal is to release a production-capable native Mac FICS chess client. The code will be reusable and support iOS/TV targets as well.
